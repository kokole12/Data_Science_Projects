# Project 1
## Question: Option 1: Let’s say you’re a Product Data Scientist at Instagram. How would you measure the success of the Instagram TV product?

To measure the success of instagram tv products, you can look at the number of likes on the video and compare that to the number of views on the TV product can be used to determine the success of the TV prodcut and we can look at the watch time of the TV prodcut per instagram user.

After looking at the metrics above then we compare that to target goal of the video product for instance lets say the video was estimated to have 2 million views and approximately 170, 000 likes. therefore we can compare the results to the predictions to determine the success of the TV product.
