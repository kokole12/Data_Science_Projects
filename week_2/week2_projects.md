# **Question 1**

# **Question 2**
Letâ€™s say we want to build a model to predict booking prices on Airbnb. Between linear regression and random forest regression, which model would perform better and why?

- Before going in to the selection of the model we can consider afew factors that will make us choose one model over the other that linear regression and Random forest. the factors include the following

- **Assess Linearity**
start by visualizing the relationships between your features and booking prices and incase you observe a linear relationship then linear regression can 
be the best fit or else randm forest can be use.

- **Data Size**
Random forest requires larger datasets to perform well, and they involve many decision trees. and incase you have a small dataset then linear regression is the best to avoid overlifting

- **Interpretability**
consider whether interpretability is the target of your model and incase you have to present the results to stalk holders then linear regression is simple.

- **Model complexity**
Assess the complexity of your problem and if the relationship between features and booking prices is nonlinear and complex then Random forest is the choice.

- **Performance Evaluation**
Finally evaluate the performance of the models using the desired metrics such as mean absolute error, R-squared and cross-validation techniques to check which model performs better.

How ever if I am to choose, I will choose Random forsest Reasons being

- **Classifiction and Regression Tasks**
Random forest is a versatile algorithm suitable for various scenarios which in this case fits because of the details involved in the AirBnB dataset and can prove effective in such a big dataset.

- **High-dimensional Data**
Random forest works great with datasets with alot of features and can handle the complexity of this data effectively.

- **Robustness to outliers**
Random forest is less sensitive to outliers and noisy data compared to linear regression algorithm because random forest is ensemble in nature.

- **Nonlinear relationships**
If the data exhibits nonlinear relationships between features and target variable, Random forest can capture these patterns better than linear models.

- **Feature Importance**
 Random Forest provides a measure of feature importance, helping you understand which variables are most influential in making predictions.
